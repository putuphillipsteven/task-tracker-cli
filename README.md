1. Its simple, clone this repo first.
1. Make sure youre in the root directory(not in src or any other folders).
1. Run command `javac TaskCLI.java`.
1. You will see in `src/data` there is a file that named ignore.json, let it be, its because the github dont allow an empty folders to be pushed.
1. To create a json files that contain our task, we must run one command at least. For me, its a `java TaskCLI.java list`
1. Please check if shown a file named tasks.json in `src/data`(if not, [contact me](https://putuphillipsteven.netlify.app/contact) please).
